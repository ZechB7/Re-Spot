## How it Works

This website is a community-driven platform where people share and review their favorite Spotify playlists. Users can search for playlists based on specific users and leave ratings and comments to share their thoughts with the community. The website will also features a leaderboard of the most reviewed playlists and a section for featured curators. Overall, it's a great place to discover new music and connect with other music lovers.

- HTML - this is the markup language for our document to be displayed on the web browser
- CSS - this is the language we use to style an HTML document as well as describes how HTML elements should be displayed.
- JavaScript - this  is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else
- React - this allows developers to build reusable UI components that can be easily composed to create complex user interfaces. It follows a declarative approach where developers describe how the UI should look and behave in response to changes in state, rather than imperatively defining how to manipulate the DOM.
- MongoDB - this is an open-source, NoSQL, document-oriented database management system. It is designed to store and manage data in a flexible and scalable manner.

## Future Features
With this project we would like to expand our scope beyond

These are some of our purposed additions:
- We would like to let the user connect and follow said playlists through the site
- We would like to let the user sample 30 second snippetsof songs from the playlists
- We would like to allow users to search genres instead of just users playlists for broader searching
